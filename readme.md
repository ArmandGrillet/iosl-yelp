# IoSL Project winter semester 2015/2015

## How to work on this project
### Required directories 
- Clone this repository in an empty folder.
- Download the Yelp dataset and copy it in the folder.
- Download [Apache Drill](https://drill.apache.org/download/) and extract in in the folder.

You should now have three directories in the folder:

1. apache-drill-1.2.0
2. iosl-business-ws1516
3. yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset

### Required software
To run our code you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Our project is based on Apache Drill thus you should [start it](https://drill.apache.org/docs/starting-drill-on-linux-and-mac-os-x/) before doing anything else. If the [Web Interface of Drill](http://localhost:8047/) is live it's working!

### Testing simple queries
Open the terminal, go on the 'queries' directories. You'll first need to install the dependencies through `npm install`, once it's done you can run scrips with a simple command like `node example.js`.
